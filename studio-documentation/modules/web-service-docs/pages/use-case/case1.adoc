== How to get A specif Product in axelor instance .

In this example we want to retrieve a product data by sending a request to an axelor instance.
It is a connector with one request of type ‘GET’. It will fetch the product by a specific ID .

== Authentication

We have to create an authentication to connect with an axelor instance .
it's a custom authentication used , we need to provide a username and a password to be authenticated .
the request of authentication is :

The authentication is e basic and the token is sored in the cookies , so we chose the cookie option .
By click on authenticate button , you can check if the authentication is correct or not .

== Get product request

To get a product by id ,  you can send a request to :
----
GET :  baseUrl/com.axelor.apps.db.Product/{productID}
----

image::getProduct.png[get product request]

TIP: you can provide the product id via a context , by passing the product context in the BPM Connector script .
every dynamic value must donate by ${} , it is processed by a groovy template .

== Get product connector

Here we specify the requests to execute , we have only one ( Get product ), also we need to define the base url used .

NOTE: You can pass the product context via the connector script in the axelor BPM
