== The purpose of connector

The connector allows you to create different api requests.
One authenticator is required to select in most cases to authenticate all requests from the connector.
On calling of the connector it performs requests by sequence. The result of the previous request can be accessed with the sequence of requests.
For example **‘_1’** will contain values returned from request **‘1’**, so it can be used with second or subsequent requests.
At the end the connector returns the result of all requests called.
// Pease see this link bellow to understand more of result request
