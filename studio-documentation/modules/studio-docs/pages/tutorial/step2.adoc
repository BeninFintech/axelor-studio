= Define Authenticator
:toc-title:

We have defined the connector in the previous step , i and we have noticed that it uses an Authentication element , so let's define this element .

== The purpose of Authentication

An authenticator is used to configure requests used for authentication purposes.
One authenticator can be used with multiple connectors.
Currently, it supports two types of authentication Oauth-2 and basic.
// Pease see this link bellow to understand more of result request

== Elements of  Authentication

<1> **App :**  Use axelor application plugin
<2> **Name of authentication :** The name of the authentication ( Required) .
<3> **Authenticate ( button ) :** It will call the selected ‘Auth request’ and store its result inside ‘Auth response’.
If the authentication is successful it will check the ‘Authenticated’  checkbox.
<4> **Authenticated :** A checkbox that is auto checked when the authentication is successful.
<5> **Authentication request :** The api request for authentication.
<6> **Auth response :** Text field to store response by calling authentication request.
<7> **Auth type :** Type of the authentication, which is basic in basic authentication.

== Authentication type

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity.
There are several types of authentication methods commonly used , our web Service project support two major  types, **Basic Auth** and **Oauth2 auth**

=== Basic authentication

Basic Authentication is a simple authentication mechanism where the client includes a username and password in the request headers.
The server verifies the credentials by comparing them to a stored username and password combination.
However, it is important to note that Basic Authentication sends the credentials in plain text,
which makes it susceptible to interception if used over unsecured channels.
Therefore, it is recommended to use Basic Authentication over secure connections (e.g., HTTPS).

.Example request headers for Basic Authentication:
[#ex-base]
----
GET /api/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)
----

In web Service project we used also the basic authentication with two-way ,
the standard way is to provide the username and the password ,
but we can use it with another way with provide a request authentication ,
it is possible that the server used for authentication is using a custom authentication method or implementing a variant of Basic Authentication where
the credentials are passed in the request body  or the headers.

==== Standard Basic authentication

image::basic-auth.png[Basic authentication]

When select the basic  authentication , two fields appear ( username , password ), we can add an authentication request  to do a custom authentication to an API .

NOTE: When select an authentication request  **( a custom authentication )** , the username and password fields will **disappear** .

==== Custom Authentication

when we add a request authentication , a field appear to chose between two modes : **Jeton** and **Cookie**

image::tokenCookie.png[Basic authentication]

===== Cookie

That's mean the token is saved as a cookie in the headers of the response's request authentication .

===== Jeton

In many implementation of creation sessions of authentication , there is always some custom implementation , that's mean we can not find the token in the headers or in the cookies , but we can find it in the body of the response , for that we need to add the name of the attribute in the body response to extract the token .

=== Oauth authentication

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that allows users to grant limited access to their protected resources (such as data or APIs) to third-party applications without sharing their credentials directly. It provides a secure and standardized way for users to authorize external applications to access their resources on their behalf.
This is the most common type of authentication currently used for api authentication. It allows  specific permission as per need.

image::oauth2.png[Oauth authentication]

<1> **Auth request :**  It is an api request to open permission consent window where users authenticate the necessary permission.
<2> **Token request :** On success of Auth  request it will call this token request to get an authentication token.
<3> **Refresh token request :** This request is used to get a new authentication token when the previous token is expired.

TIP: You can see the result of the execution of  the auth request and the token request and the refresh token request in the panel bellow the screen .
