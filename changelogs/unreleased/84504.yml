title: Memory leak when large number of instances.
type: fix
description: |
  Resolved the memory leak caused by inefficient log handling for BPM instances. 
  Replaced ByteArrayOutputStream with BufferedOutputStream around FileOutputStream to reduce heap memory usage and improve performance.
  Logs are now written directly to disk.
