title: Handle response types at parsing to Json , and add some improvement in WS BUILDER
type: feature
description: |
         * when getting the response of execution of a request , we parse this response to Json Object .
         there are many types of response that can be at the response , until now we manage only responses that are compatible with APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE and APPLICATION_XML_TYPE , we have to manage all existing types
         additional points :
         * manage m2o and m2m in the payload builder
         * manage Repeated Requests by storing the result of each repeated occurrence
         * tool bar is  responsive for ws-Builder now
         * Add possibility to open the request and the authentication in a new tabs in ws builder
         * Add the features in WsAuthentication ( version Xml ) to the web service React App
