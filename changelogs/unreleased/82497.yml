title: Add buttons to unblock bpm instances
type: feature
description: | 
  Add two buttons to unblock the bpm process instances. They can be found under the menu *App -> BPM components -> Technical Monitoring*.
  1. The first one is in the *Process Instances* menu, more precisely in the form view of a process instance.
      * This button will allow you to unblock the specific instance you select.
  2. The second button is in the *BPM Models* menu, in the form view of this menu.
      * This button will allow you to unblock all the instances linked to a given BPM model.
      * Even if all the instances of the model are not blocked for one model you can use it safely (it won't impact the non blocked instances).
