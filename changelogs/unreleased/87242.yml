title: BPM instance are not started when the record is created from an other bpm.
type: fix
description:
  Resolved the issue where BPM instances were not starting when triggered by another BPM process.
  Added two configurable parameters in axelor-config.properties to address potential database connection issues;
  "studio.bpm.max.idle.connections" Controls the maximum number of idle database connections (default 10). And
  "studio.bpm.max.active.connections" Defines the maximum number of active database connections (default 50).
