title: Incorrect variable handling causing some fields to be ignored
type: fix
description: |
  Fixed the issue where some fields were ignored due to incorrect variable handling,
  Updated serialization and deserialization of variables.
  Added configuration for serialization depth via `axelor-config.properties`:
  - Introduced property `studio.bpm.serialization.depth` to control the depth of serialization.
  - Default depth set to 5, with a maximum value of 10.
