= Transformation library
:toc-title:
:page-pagination:

The web service solution  implement a mechanism that provides a transformations libraries. When a transformation is used, a groovy expression will be generated. this expression contains the necessary code that will perform the transformation.

== Structure of The transformation module

Transformations will be previously configured in the AOS, each transformation will come with a groovy template expression which will allow the transformation to be  executed in the backend side. So when the user uses the application , he will find all the transformations grouped by available libraries.

This way, you can define any type of transformation, You can even define a very complex  transformation as you want, which may not exist in the standard libraries.

**Rules:**

- The Groovy template contains placeholders for the parameters and the target ( kind of +${target}+ +${search}+). In the front-end, these placeholders will be filled in to generate the appropriate groovy expression.

- target is the value which the transformation will be performed on it.

- Every groovy expression must contain the target placeholder.

- Every defined parameter must have the corresponding placeholder.


**Example: abs transformation will be executed by the expression Math.abs(target)**

We get this result by using this groovy template:

----
{target-> Math.abs(target) }(target);
----

== Math Library

Using the Groovy programming language, you can perform various mathematical operations to transform expressions. Here are some commonly used mathematical operations:

* **Addition**: The "+" operator is used to add numerical values or variables together. It can be used with various data types, such as int, double,
or float.
* **Subtraction**: The "-" operator subtracts one numerical value or variable from another. It is also used with different data types.
* **Multiplication**: The "*" operator multiplies numerical values or variables. It is used to calculate the product of two expressions.
* **Exponentiation**: The Math.pow() function allows you to raise an expression to a specified power. It takes two arguments: the base expression and the exponent.

There is a large mathematics transformations that you can use for your parameters or payloads .

== Date Library

In Groovy, one commonly used date and time library , This package provides a comprehensive set of classes for working with dates, times, durations, and time zones.

Here is some commonly used Date operations:

* **Get_day** : Get day of the month , extract the day of the month from  date .
* **Minus_days** : Subtract days from the given date.
* **Date_format** : Format the given date according to the given format pattern .

== Text library

Transforming text using a text manipulation library in Groovy, there are several libraries available that can assist you in performing various transformations on text data.
Here are some commonly used Date operations:

* **replace** : Replace a text phrase with another. Search can be any word in the value and the replacement can be anything.
* **string_length** : Returns the number of characters of a string.
* **index** : Returns the index of the case-sensitive expression or false if it can't be found.  The search term can be any string of text. Returns an integer value of where the character(s) exist in the string.

== Array Library

Arrays provide a versatile set of operations that can be performed to manipulate and analyze data efficiently.
Some common operations that can be performed on arrays include:

* **push** : add an element to an existing array
* **pop** : remove an element from an existing array
* **filter** : filter an array's elements according to a condition.

== Other libraries

You have the flexibility to add multiple libraries to your project,  this libraries will contain a large transformations to help you with your needs .
