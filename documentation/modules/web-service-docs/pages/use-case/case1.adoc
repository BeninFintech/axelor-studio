For using the Axelor Rest API  You can refer to the axelor documentation in the official site for creating your requests and connecting to axelor instance .

== How get A specific Product in Axelor instance .

In this example we want to retrieve a product data by sending a request to an axelor instance.
It is a connector with one request of type **GET**. It will fetch the product by a specific ID .

The web service is accessible with following url pattern:
----
GET /ws/rest/:model/:id
----

.Request
----
GET /ws/rest/com.axelor.apps.base.db.Product/1 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
----
== Authentication

We have to create an authentication to connect with an axelor instance .
it's a custom authentication used , We need to provide a **username** and a **password** to be authenticated .

the request of authentication is :

image::axelorAuth.png[auth axelor,align="left"]

The authentication is a basic and the token is stored in the cookies , so we chose the cookie option .
By click on the authenticate button , you can test if the authentication is correct or not .

== Get product request

To get a product by id ,  you can send a request to :
----
GET :  baseUrl/com.axelor.apps.db.Product/{productID}
----

image::getProduct.png[get product request,align="left"]

TIP: You can provide the product id via a context , by passing the product context in the BPM Connector script .
every dynamic value must donate by ${} , it is processed by a groovy template .

== Get product connector

Here we specify the requests to execute , we have only one ( Get product ), also we need to define the base URL used .

image::connectorGetProduct.png[get product request,align="left"]

NOTE: You can pass the product context via the connector script in the axelor BPM
