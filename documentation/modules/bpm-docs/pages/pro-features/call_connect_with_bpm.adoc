=== Implementing a Service Task in a BPM Model

1. Open your BPM model in the BPM designer.
2. Add a new `Service Task` to your model where you want the Connect scenario to be triggered.
3. In the service task settings, select the `Connect` (1) & (2) option from the list of available service types.
4. A list of existing scenarios within your Connect organization will be displayed (3) & (4). Select the scenario you wish to trigger.

== Deployment and Execution

1. Once your BPM model is configured with the Connect service task, deploy the process to your BPM engine.
2. Trigger a new instance of the process. This can be done through your application's user interface or via an API call, depending on your setup.
3. When the service task is activated during the process execution, the corresponding Connect scenario will be automatically triggered.

== Monitoring and Troubleshooting

* Monitor the execution of your process and the Connect scenario through the BPM and Connect module dashboards, respectively.
* In case of any issues, check the logs for errors related to the Connect scenario execution or the service task configuration.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate external services and workflows into your BPM processes, enhancing your application's capabilities and automating complex workflows.
